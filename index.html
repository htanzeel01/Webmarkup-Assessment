                <p>Haarlem with its many historic buildings and beautiful old squares lies near the beach on the banks of the Spaarne river. 
                    It is wonderful to stroll through the narrow streets lined by the monumental buildings built by master Lieven de Key.

                <h2>Frans Hals Museum: </h2>
                
                <p class="p1">The Frans Hals Museum is divided over two locations: Hof and Hal. They are within a short, scenic walk from each other, through historic Haarlem.

                        Now home to an array of art treasures, our Hof location was once a home for old men; a place where, in the Golden Age, gentlemen enjoyed their golden years. But since 1913, this courtyard building of Groot Heiligland has exhibited the municipal art collection, with numerous highlights from the same Golden Age.
                        
                        Between being an Old Men’s House and a museum, the building also served as an orphanage for just under a century. From 1810 onwards, it sheltered numerous orphaned children, one of whom was the painter and writer Jacobus van Looy (1855-1930).
                        Municipal museum
                        
                        In 1908 the municipality bought the buildings with the aim of exhibiting the municipal art collection there, as it had outgrown the space in the town hall. Large parts of the Old Men’s House were demolished and rebuilt in early 17th-century style, as designed by city architect Lucas Christiaan Dumont (1865-1935). On 14 May 1913, the Frans Hals Museum opened its doors to the public for the first time.

                    <h3>The Beggining</h3>
                    <p>
                            Taekwondo is young as far as martial arts go, being developed in the 1940’s and 50’s through the work of several martial artists.
                            Korean martial artists with experience in martial arts such as karate, Chinese martial arts, and indigenous Korean martial arts traditions such as Taekkyon, Subak, and Gwonbeop have had influence in developing taekwondo.

                    <p>
                            The first Taekwondo federation was founded in 1959, the Korea Taekwondo Association.
                            In 1972 the Korea Taekwondo Association and the South Korean government's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism established the Kukkiwon as the new national academy for Taekwondo.
                            Since the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games Taekwondo has been one of only two Asian martial arts (the other being Judo) which are featured in the Olympic Games after it was a demonstration event in the 1988 Seoul Games.
